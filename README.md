#Using social media for actionable extreme weather event surveillance

#Project Overview:

Many resources exist to monitor weather conditions worldwide. These data sources are
acquired by different sensors such as satellites, weather stations, radars. The scale of
this information is relatively coarse for your city because measurements are averaged
every hour or four-days. To access this information, users need to navigate into different
URLs, have some previous knowledge of the data structure and sometimes acquire
credentials to access such information. Also, many mobile weather apps exist, all of
them provide basic current and 10-day forecast, weather conditions, such as air
temperature, wind, some of them overlay radar data, pollen index, etc.

In the occurrence of an extreme event, such as flash floods, fires, snowstorms, heat
waves, etc. the information provided from governmental and private sources are not
updated in near-real-time. This makes it difficult for communities, first responders,
citizens in general to prepare or better respond to an extreme event.

#Research Question: Can “listening” to social media help improve monitoring of
extreme weather events?
